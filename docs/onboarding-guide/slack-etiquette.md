Slack helps us stay connected, ask questions, collaborate on issues, and learn from one another. But like any communication tool, the way we use it affects the experience of everyone else.

As our community continues to expand, it's easy to forget that small habits like saying just "hi" before your actual message or sending multiple back-to-back replies can make conversations harder to follow. 

This guide outlines a few ways we can make Slack more respectful, organized, and inclusive for everyone.

You don’t need to be perfect. These aren’t hard rules, but they’re good habits that help us collaborate better.

### Why etiquette matters

In our Slack workspace, most people contribute asynchronously, meaning that your message might not be seen immediately. So, make sure it's clear, concise, and easy to respond to. Keeping threads organized, reducing noise, and respecting others' time helps create a space where everyone feels heard and informed.

### Tips for better Slack collaboration

* **Be specific and provide context:** Instead of just saying "hi", "I need help", or "anyone here?", make sure your message is clear and specific. This will help others understand what you're asking and provide better assistance.  
    > ❌ hi
    > ✅ Hi! I'm trying to generate an AsyncAPI spec from a Kafka service using the CLI, but I'm stuck on config. My current config looks as follows: `<your-current-config>` Any tips?

* **Use threads for ongoing conversations:** Threads help keep topics organized and channels easier to browse. If someone replies to your question, respond in a thread—unless they’ve already moved it elsewhere intentionally.

* **Minimize notifications:** Avoid tagging `@channel` or `@here` unless it’s truly important for everyone. Use emoji reactions instead of “+1” or “I agree” messages.

* **Default to public channels:** Public channels make information discoverable. If you're asking a question that others might have too, try asking it in a relevant channel instead of a direct message.

* **Use formatting to improve readability:** Break long posts into paragraphs or bullet points. Use backticks (`code`) for code snippets, and bold or emoji to highlight important points.

* **Respect focus and availability:** People are often balancing time zones, meetings, or other tasks. Slack queues messages when someone is in "Do Not Disturb" mode, no need to follow up right away.

* **Mute wisely, not blindly:** If you're interested only in specific topics within a channel (for example, related to website or docs), you can mute it and configure [keyword notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#keyword-notifications) to get notified only when those keywords are mentioned.

### What we value

Above all, our community values respectful, thoughtful conversation.

If you’re ever unsure how to engage, ask yourself: *Is this clear, kind, and useful?* If yes, you’re on the right track.
