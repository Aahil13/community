Slack helps us stay connected, ask questions, collaborate on issues, and learn from one another. But like any communication tool, the way we use it affects the experience of everyone else.

As our community continues to expand, it's easy to forget that small habits like saying just "hi" before your actual message or sending multiple back-to-back replies can make conversations harder to follow. 

This guide outlines a few ways we can make Slack more respectful, organized, and inclusive for everyone.

You don't need to be perfect. These aren't hard rules, but they're good habits that help us collaborate better.

### Why etiquette matters

In our Slack workspace, most people contribute asynchronously, meaning that your message might not be seen immediately. So, make sure it's clear, concise, and easy to respond to. Keeping threads organized, reducing noise, and respecting others' time helps create a space where everyone feels heard and informed.

### Tips for better Slack collaboration

* **Be specific and provide context:** Instead of just saying "hi", "I need help", or "anyone here?", make sure your message is clear and specific. This will help others understand what you're asking and provide better assistance.  
    > ❌ hi  
    > ✅ Hi! I'm trying to generate an AsyncAPI spec from a Kafka service using the CLI, but I'm stuck on config. My current config looks as follows: `<your-current-config>` Any tips?

* **Use threads for ongoing conversations:** Threads help keep topics organized and channels easier to browse. If someone replies to your question, respond in a thread unless they've already moved it elsewhere intentionally.

* **Minimize notification triggers:** Ensure you know who you want to address your message to. If you need to get the attention of someone specific, you can mention that person directly. Use the `@everyone`, `@channel`, `@here` mentions sparingly, only when attention of a large portion of the channel participants is crucial. Avoid "+1" or "I agree" messages at all costs, use emoji reactions instead.

* **Prefer public channels:** Public channels make information easier to find. Ask questions in relevant channels because it helps others learn from the discussion and find answers later. Additionally, it promotes a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration.

* **Use formatting to improve readability:** Break long posts into paragraphs or bullet points. Use backticks (`) for code snippets, and bold (or relevant emojis) to emphasize important points.

* **Respect focus and availability:** People are often balancing time zones, meetings, or other tasks. Slack queues messages when someone is in "Do Not Disturb" mode, no need to follow up right away.

* **Mute wisely, not blindly:** If you're interested only in specific topics within a channel (for example, related to website or docs), you can mute it and configure [keyword notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#keyword-notifications) to get notified only when those keywords are mentioned.

### What we value

Above all, our community values respectful, thoughtful conversation.

If you're ever unsure how to participate in a conversation or respond to a message, ask yourself: *Is my response clear, kind, and useful?* If it is, you're likely on the right track.
