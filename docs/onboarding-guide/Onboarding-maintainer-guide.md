# Onboarding Guide for AsyncAPI Maintainers

Welcome to the AsyncAPI Maintainer Onboarding Guide! 

This guide is designed to provide you with everything you need to begin your journey as a maintainer within the AsyncAPI ecosystem. Whether youâ€™re managing workflows, mentoring new contributors, or ensuring that the project stays on track, your role is essential to the success of the community.

Maintainers are the backbone of any open-source project. You help ensure that processes run smoothly, contributors are supported, and the project evolves sustainably. This guide will help you navigate your responsibilities, from managing code contributions to creating workflows and fostering a healthy, productive community.

Before we go into getting you started, let's try and clarify just *who* a maintainer is.

## Who is an AsyncAPI Maintainer?

A maintainer is an individual who plays a crucial role in overseeing and guiding the development and growth of an open-source project. As a maintainer for AsyncAPI, you will manage pull requests, resolve issues, enforce coding standards, and ensure the community thrives by helping contributors.

As a maintainer, you'll be responsible for:

- Overseeing the technical direction of the project
- Managing workflows and GitHub Actions to automate tasks
- Identifying and appointing new maintainers
- Mentoring new contributors and helping them navigate their journey
- Recognizing and rewarding contributions to foster community engagement

Basically, you're the *glue* that holds the project together and ensures that everything runs smoothly.

## Steps to becoming a Maintainer

Before you can become a **maintainer**, you need to start as a **contributor**. The journey from contributor to maintainer is a rewarding one, and it involves the following steps:

### 1. **Pick an Issue**

   - **Join existing PR reviews**: If you're not sure where to start, begin by reviewing open [pull requests](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pulls). This will give you an understanding of the code and where your contributions might fit in.

   - **Look for "*good first issue*" labels**: These [issues](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues) are beginner-friendly and will help you get familiar with the projectâ€™s structure. Additionally, you can check out the [#97_bot-github-new-issues-prs](https://asyncapi.slack.com/archives/C01J06RL10X) channel on Slack for new issues and PRs.

  - **Participate in live streams**: AsyncAPI maintainers sometimes host [live streams](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/events) where they walk through parts of the project. You can request a session on the specific area you want to contribute to.

   > **NOTE**: Make sure whatever issue you pick isn't marked "Do-not-merge" else your PR won't be merged.

### 2. **Open a Pull Request**

For a comprehensive guide on how to open a pull request, refer to the [AsyncAPI Git Workflow Guide](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/git-workflow.md).

   - **Fork the repository**: Fork the repository you want to contribute to and create a new branch for your changes.

   - **Make changes**: Implement the changes required to resolve the issue you picked. Ensure your code adheres to the projectâ€™s coding standards.

   - **Submit a Pull Request**: Once youâ€™re done, submit a pull request to the main repository. Make sure to include a detailed description of your changes.

   - **Participate in discussions**: Engage with maintainers and other contributors in the PR comments section. This will help you understand the project better and improve your contributions.

### 3. **Get your Pull Request Merged**

   - After submitting a pull request, itâ€™s time for the maintainers to review it.

   - If you notice no one reviewing your PR (which is rare) or if you need a review urgently, donâ€™t hesitate to ping the maintainers on Slack or GitHub

   - Make sure all the checks (tests, style checks, etc.) turn green for a smooth merge.

### 4. **Receive an invitation to become a Maintainer ðŸŽ‰**

   - **Recognition**: After contributing consistently, the maintainers will invite you to join the team. This invitation is a recognition of your contributions and dedication.

   - If you feel you've made enough contributions, but haven't received an invitation, you can open an issue in the relevant repository to discuss your contributions with the maintainers. You can see an example of such an issue [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/issues/1616).
